|  Purpose:  The purpose of this is to make the original code of the
|               DNA. The program will replicate DNA like code to solve
|               a simple problem like [insert problem here]
|
|  Pre-condition:  The Precondition is to create a Male array and
|                    Female array. The arrays will then be matched up
|                    to then run through a process similar to mitosis
|
|  Post-condition: The two arrays come together to create a chomosomes 
|                    and a cell like structure to then be replicated 
|                    as cells
