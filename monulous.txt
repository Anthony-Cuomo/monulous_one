Actual Intelligence

Big picture - create Intelligence that will create itself through 
                a process similar to cell replication.
                The goal is to solve a small mathematical 
                problem.

step one:
    - use object to create one chromosome to be replicated
    - get two sets of original code(chromosomes):
    - need to break down chromosomes furthur
    - create each chromosome with specific DNA
    - I believe a PLC can run this logic to create Intelligence
    - code is then replicated into a chain:
	- start with mitosis
	Ex: DNA 

notes: Start Codon most common
    maybe use a start codon to create replication ...
    once replicated then start problems
